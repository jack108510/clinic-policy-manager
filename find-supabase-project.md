# Finding Your Supabase Project

The project reference ID is: `wkbntjfiwzoauzxnowfc`

## Option 1: Search for the Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Look at the project list - the project might be named something like:
   - "clinic-policy-manager"
   - "wkbntjfiwzoauzxnowfc"
   - Or any other name you gave it

3. If you see multiple organizations, check each one

## Option 2: Find by URL

The project URL is: `https://wkbntjfiwzoauzxnowfc.supabase.co`

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click "All Projects" or check all organizations
3. Look for a project that matches this reference

## Option 3: Create a New Project (If you can't find it)

If you can't find the project, we can create a new one:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: "Inventory Ordering Platform" (or any name)
   - Database Password: (choose a strong password)
   - Region: (choose closest to you)
4. Click "Create new project"
5. Wait for it to finish setting up (2-3 minutes)

Then I'll help you:
- Update the configuration with the new project URL and keys
- Set up the database schema
- Create your user account
- Disable email confirmation

## Option 4: Check if You Have Access

The project might belong to a different Supabase account. If someone else set it up:
- Ask them to add you as a collaborator
- Or use their account to disable email confirmation

Let me know which option you'd like to proceed with!
